	    <h1>The Art of War - Sun Tzu</h1>
	    <small class="text-muted">Date written: 07-09-2025</small>
	    
	    <br>

	    <p>I finally managed to get my hands onto Sun Tzu's The Art of War after heard about it since the past few years. I kept wondering why would people still talk about it despite the ancient document had been published for over 2,500 thousands years ago. It turns out the idea and philosophy behind the book are still applicable today, especially in running an organizations. I got mine from the Collins Classic and it's a little book with only 96 pages including the glossary.</p> 

	    <p>Sun Tzu was a military general who served King Helu of Wu Nation in 514-496 BC. What I find fascinating is that, he saw and think of war as an art. These days, most people know his ideas are equivalent to the "Science of War". It is a thoughtful work on how to win the war and defeat the enemies. I read the English translation and the book laid out all of his ideas in clear, concise and easy-to-digest format, which I thought was great.</p> 

	    <p><i>"All war is based on deception".</i></p> 

	    <p>The first thing that came to my mind when I was reading this is Argo (2012). The movie was based on the real life operation to save six American diplomats during the Iran Hostage Crisis in 1979. The CIA plotted a facade and cover story to make it looked like the six diplomats were part of the Canadian film crew that shot for the science fiction film, Argo. They had all the documents and prop forged. They even broguht along Hollywood insiders to join them, all to deceive the Iranian authorities. They were all managed to escape safely.</p>

	    <p><i>"If you know yourself and your enemy then you can always win. If you know only yourself, then you may win or lose. If you know neither yourself or your enemy, then you most likely will lose."</i></p> 

	    <p>This elementary quote from the book essentially captures the whole premise of the idea. It is vital that one knows its own strengths and weaknesses and being aware of the strengths and weaknesses to win the war. Also, it is equally as important that one knows the physical environment where the war is to be fought. </p>

	    <p>What captures me solely is the idea that Sun Tzu put utmost emphasis on the supply chain aspect. Sun Tzu stresses that war is not only won by the strategy on the battlefield but also in ensuring that the army are well-fed and in intact supplies. In war, speed matters as the longer the campaign is, the more resources it uses. He further stresses the idea behind leveraging local resources. Use your enemy's supplies to reduce the burden of your own resources and logistics. </p>

	    <p>It reminded me a lot of the US military capability which is hailed as having the most robust and advanced war supply chain and logistics in the world. Logistics is part of the strategy. During the Operation Desert Storm in 1991, they deployed around half a million armies and tons of equipment to the Middle East in a matter of months. It also reminds me of Operation Barbossa in 1941. The failure of the supply chain halted the German soliders advancement in the Soviet territory. Supply chain stretched for hundreds of miles. On top of that, the German relied primarily on horse-and-wagon transportation system which is insufficient for modern warfare.</p>

	    <p>My favourite chapters from the book are chapter 9 (The Army on the March), chapter 10 (Terrain) and chapter 11 (The Nine Situations) as I was given a new perspectives regarding the battlefiled. When it comes to war, common aspects that I've always heard are strategy and strength without fully understand the underlying nuances. In chapter 9, Sun Tzu highlights about outsmarting by observation. Learn the environmental cues ranging from birds, dust clouds and even campfires. In life, we are always taught to "read the room" but that in war, this thing will determine if someone will lose his lives. In Terrain, he put emphasis on the different type of grounds. Ground shapes enemy's choice. Pick the ground where enemy is at disadvantageous and constrained. The Nine Situation highlights on the morale deception and manipulation. He argues that it is crucial for soliders to fight with desperation and the enemy to fight with doubt.</p>

	    <p>This book is a great dive into the mind of one of the greatest military generals of all time. It provides new perspectives to me on the little things called "strategy" and "tactic" and also other things that attached greatly to the aspect of war such as supply chain and physical environment. I highly recommend it.</p>
